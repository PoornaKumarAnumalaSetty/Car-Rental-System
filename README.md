🚗✨ Car Rental System – Java Project Description
The Car Rental System is a simple yet powerful Java application that simulates a real-world vehicle rental platform 🏁. Built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and connected to a MySQL database, it allows users to rent vehicles and admins to manage the fleet, ensuring smooth rental operations.

🔧 Tech Stack Used
🧠 Java (OOP Concepts: Inheritance, Encapsulation, Polymorphism)

🗃️ MySQL (Database for storing vehicle, user, and rental data)

🔌 JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)

🖥️ VS Code as the development environment

🧩 Core Features
👤 User Functionality:
View available vehicles 🚙

Rent a vehicle for a number of days 📆

Automatically calculate rental cost 💰

🛠️ Admin Panel:
Secure login 🔐 (Password protected)

Add new vehicles to the system ➕

Remove unavailable or old vehicles ➖

View full inventory list 📋

🔍 Interesting Highlights
💾 MySQL Integration: All vehicles, rentals, and users are persisted in a real database!

📦 Modular Structure: Organized into packages like model, service, and utils for clean, maintainable code.

🔁 Reusability & Scalability: Easily add new vehicle types like Electric Cars, Vans, or Scooters using inheritance!

💳 Mock Payment System: Simulates real-world payments (can be extended to real payment APIs).

🚦 Live Availability Check: Only shows vehicles available for rental at the moment.

💼 Admin Tools: Simplifies management of large fleets for business-like scenarios.
